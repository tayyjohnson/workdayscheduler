# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


So this week's challenge was to create a "Work Day Scheduler" that assists an employee with checking off their daily tasks.
This scheduler will be color-coded for a more organized approach on which tasks 
the employee is currently on, which tasks are next & which tasks have already been completed.

This scheduler is also meant to help manage the employee's time effectively so their tasks can be completed by the end of the work day.

Seeing how nice & neat this made things for the "employee" - I just might use it for myself to manage my time effectively!
